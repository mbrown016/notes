### PREDICTIVE MODELING ###

* How do we segment the population with respect to something we would like to know or predict?
* Start by finding informative attributes -- those that are coorilated with the target attribute we wish to predict.
* Two types of "supervised" models (where the outcome is knowable):
      - Classification (inc Class-probability-estimation models)
      - Regression
* Selecting Informative Attributes -- Decision Tree or Tree-based models:
      - Entropy -- how mixed or impure the segment is with respect to the properties of interest
      		* 1 = impure, 0 = pure
     		* entropy = -P1 x log2(P1) - P2 x log2(P2) - ...
		* Pi = relative percentage of property 'i' within the set
      - Information Gain (IG) -- the change in entropy due to new info added to the model
      		* IG (parent, children) = entropy (parent) - [P(c1) x entropy(c1) + P(c2) x entropy(c2) ... ]
		* P = proportion of instance that belong to child
		* The entropy for each child is weighted by P
