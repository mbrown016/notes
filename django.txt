FUNCTIONALITY
-------------
* views = public interface.  They are the templates for page types (e.g. Homepage, articles, etc)
* To get from a URL to a view, we use 'URLconfs' which maps URL patterns to views
* Each view does one of two things:
       - return a HTTPResponse, or
       - raise an exception, such as HTTP 404
* Models  --  each model refers to a DB table
* Each attribute of the model represents a DB field
