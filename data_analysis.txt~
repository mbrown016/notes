### DATA ANALYSIS ###

* Step 1  --  Look at the data!

SINGLE VARIABLE ANALYSIS
------------------------
* Dot and Jitter plots
* Histograms
	- Scott's rule for bin size = 3.5 stdev / [ n ^(1/3)]
* Kernal Density Estimates
  	- Better than histograms because:
	  	 * Histograms are not unique
		 * Histograms are not smooth curves
		 * The smooth KDE curves are better for computers for future calculations
		 * Histograms don't handle outliers gracefully
	- Gaussian kernel is the most widely used
* Cumulative Distribution Function
  	- The CDF at point x tells us what % of events has occured to the left of x
	- Less noisy than histogram while containing the same data
* Summary Stats (mean, median, stdev, percent rank) only apply to normal distributions!
* Median and percentiles are more flexible and robust than mean, stdev, etc.
* Inter-quartile range (IQR)  --  the distance between the 75th and 25th percentile
  	- This measure replaces stdev for non-normal distributions
* Box plots can be used to show median and percentiles

BIVARIATE ANALYSIS (2 VARIABLES)
--------------------------------
* Most commonly used to look at the relationship between the two variables
* Basic  --  scatter plot, plot one variable against another
  	 - Smoothing the data helps w/ noisy data sets (Splines & LOESS)
	 - Splines  --  goal is overall smoothness (less responsive to local details)
	 - LOESS  --  more responsive, computationally intense
	 - After smoothing, look at the residuals (remainder of the data)
	   	 * Should be balanced, free from trend
		 * May want to plot ABS to look at magnitude
		 * May want to use QQ plot to check for Gaussian
* Logarithmic Plots
  	 - 3 benefits:
		 * Reigns in large variations in data
		 * Turn multiplicative variations into addition
		 * They reveal exponential and power law behavior
	 - 2 types:
		 * semi-logarithmic (single) plots  --  1 axis is log
		 * double logarithmic (log-log) plots -- both axis are log
* Banking
	 - changing the aspect ratio of the graph to make the slope ~45 degrees
* Linear regression
  	 - Most over used tool in statistics!
	 - Applies when we have a set of input values (control) and for each, we measure an output value (response)
	 - Linear regression gives us a predictive line that minimizes error
	 - Ask 3 questions before using:
	         * Do you need regression? Regression only makes sense when used for prediction.
		 * Is the linear assumption appropriate?  Can the data be described by a straight line?
		 * Is something else going on (outliers, wierd data, etc)?
